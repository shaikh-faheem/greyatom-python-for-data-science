### Project Overview

 In this project we are going to decipher text message, Fuse two text message, compare them , filter them as per condition

### Learnings from the project

 1.String operations
2.Conditional statement and loops
3.File I/O
4.Functions


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Since it was my very first project I tried to implement the basic concepts that i have learned so far.



### Challenges faced

 There was a part where I was suppose to compare two message. 
I was required to Store all the words that are there in a_list but not in b_list.
I started of using For loop to solve the problem, but later got to know about list comprehension , which effectively reduced my code.



### Additional pointers

 It  was decent project to start off with where I learned more about String operations and conditional statement and loops.
Also about Function and list Comprehension.
